        <h2>🌿 About Evergreen</h2>
        <p>At Evergreen, we believe a dispensary should be more than just a place to buy cannabis — it should be a space that uplifts, educates, and strengthens the community it serves.</p>
        <p>Rooted right here in Battle Creek, we’re proud to be a local business built by and for the people who call this city home. From day one, we’ve prioritized hiring talent from within our neighborhood, ensuring that every team member reflects the diverse, vibrant spirit of Battle Creek. By investing in local people, we’re helping grow opportunities, create jobs, and keep resources circulating in our own backyard.</p>
        <p>At Evergreen, every customer who walks through our doors is treated like a neighbor, not a number. We’re here to answer questions, provide guidance, and offer personalized recommendations with patience and care, no matter your level of experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Locally owned and operated in Battle Creek</li>
            <li>✅ Hiring and empowering team members from within the community</li>

        <h2>🌿 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>“At Evergreen, our purpose goes beyond selling cannabis — we’re here to create an experience rooted in education, community, and trust.<br>
        We’re marketing to both seasoned consumers and the canna-curious — people who want more than a transaction; they want connection, clarity, and consistency.<br>
        Our goal is to be known as the dispensary where you don’t have to ‘know it all’ to feel welcomed. Whether you're a first-time user or a daily smoker, we meet you where you're at. We emphasize education without ego, quality without pretense, and a vibe that feels down-to-earth yet elevated.<br>
        We’re not trying to be trendy just for the sake of it. We want to be the go-to for people who value authenticity, transparency, and local roots. Evergreen stands for growth — in knowledge, community, and personal well-being.”</p>

        <h2>🌿 Our Cultivation Process: Grown with Care, Indoors</h2>
        <p>Evergreen takes pride in offering cannabis that’s grown and cultivated in our own indoor facility, ensuring every product meets the highest standards of quality, safety, and consistency.</p>
        <p>By growing indoors, we have full control over every step of the process — from seed to sale. This dedication to quality translates into cleaner, more potent, and better-tasting cannabis for our customers.</p>
        <h3>Why Indoor Cultivation Matters:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Consistent environment year-round → no weather or seasonal impact</li>
            <li>✅ Tighter control over pests and contamination → cleaner, safer flower</li>
            <li>✅ Enhanced potency → higher THC and terpene profiles through optimized growing conditions</li>
            <li>✅ Better flavor and aroma → precision-fed nutrients, light, and airflow produce superior terpene development</li>
            <li>✅ Smaller environmental footprint → water recapture systems and sustainable practices reduce waste</li>
            <li>✅ Hand-tended plants → every plant is nurtured by our growers for optimal care</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every strain you see on our shelves is a result of intentional, small-batch cultivation — not mass production. That means when you buy from Evergreen, you’re getting cannabis that’s been grown with respect for the plant, for the science, and for the people who enjoy it.</p>
